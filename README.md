Simulation of the Boston Dynamics Spot Robot using ROS2 and Ignition Gazebo (Fortress) on a Lunar Surface
By Diya Agarwal

Adaption of [champ](https://github.com/chvmp/champ) quadruped robot to ROS2 and Ignition Gazebo. Previously, the Boston Dynamics Spot robot was only simulated using ROS2 with Gazebo Classic, which goes end-of-life in January 2025. I have created a package, modified from [quadruped_ros2](https://github.com/jediofgever/quadruped_ros2), which simulates the robot in Ignition Gazebo, a newer version of Gazebo.
